Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a free tool that allows website owners and marketers to manage and deploy marketing tags (snippets of code) on their websites without needing to modify the underlying code directly. Tags can include tracking codes for analytics, advertising, and other marketing services.

With GTM, users can:
	1.	Easily Add and Update Tags: Users can add and update tags through a web interface, reducing reliance on developers.
	2.	Manage Multiple Tags: GTM helps organize and manage various tags in one place, making it easier to implement tracking codes for different services.
	3.	Version Control: GTM provides version control, allowing users to roll back changes if needed.
	4.	Event Tracking: Users can set up triggers for specific user actions (like button clicks, form submissions, etc.) to track interactions without additional coding.
	5.	Integration with Google Services: GTM works seamlessly with other Google services like Google Analytics, Google Ads, and more.

Overall, GTM simplifies the process of managing tracking codes and provides a more efficient way to implement and monitor marketing tags.
